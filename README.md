# Reflection Search Plugin
[![Auto build](https://github.com/DKorablin/Plugin.ReflectionSearch/actions/workflows/release.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/DKorablin/Plugin.ReflectionSearch/releases/latest)

A powerful plugin extension that enables deep reflection-based searching capabilities in .NET applications. This plugin allows you to search through object properties, fields, and methods using reflection, making it ideal for complex data exploration scenarios.

## Overview

The Reflection Search plugin serves as an extension for other plugins that need to implement specific data retrieval and search functionality. It provides a framework for searching through object structures using reflection, with support for various comparison operations and deep object traversal.

## Features

- Deep reflection-based search through object hierarchies
- Support for various comparison operations (Equals, NotEquals, More, MoreOrEquals, Less, LessOrEquals, Contains)
- Ability to search through properties, fields, and methods
- Support for both primitive types and complex objects
- Automatic handling of enumerable types and collections
- Built-in support for type conversion and comparison

## Installation
To install the Reflection Search Plugin, follow these steps:
1. Download the latest release from the [Releases](https://github.com/DKorablin/Plugin.ReflectionSearch/releases)
2. Extract the downloaded ZIP file to a desired location.
3. Use the provided [Flatbed.Dialog (Lite)](https://dkorablin.github.io/Flatbed-Dialog-Lite) executable or download one of the supported host applications:
	- [Flatbed.Dialog](https://dkorablin.github.io/Flatbed-Dialog)
	- [Flatbed.MDI](https://dkorablin.github.io/Flatbed-MDI)
	- [Flatbed.MDI (WPF)](https://dkorablin.github.io/Flatbed-MDI-Avalon)
4. Download one of the supported plugins listed below and place the plugin DLLs in the same directory as the host application executable or inside Plugins folder:
	- [PE Image View](https://github.com/DKorablin/Plugin.PEImageView)
	- [ELF Image View](https://github.com/DKorablin/Plugin.ElfImageView)
	- [APK Image View](https://github.com/DKorablin/Plugin.ApkImageView)
5. Launch the host application, and select the Reflection Search Plugin from the plugins menu.
6. Choose the desired searchable objects and configure the search parameters.
7. Select desired folder to start searching and view the results.

## Implementation

To implement this plugin in your application, you need to implement three required methods:

### 1. GetEntityType()
```csharp
Type GetEntityType()
```
Returns the type of the object that will be searched. This defines the root type for reflection-based searching.

### 2. GetSearchObjects(string folderPath)
```csharp
String[] GetSearchObjects(String folderPath)
```
Returns an array of searchable object paths/identifiers. These are typically file paths or other identifiers that can be used to instantiate the searchable objects.

### 3. CreateEntityInstance(object filePath)
```csharp
Object CreateEntityInstance(Object filePath)
```
Creates an instance of the searchable object using the provided path/identifier. The instance type must match the type returned by `GetEntityType()`.

## Extension Example

To create your own plugin to use this plugin, implement the required methods in your plugin class:

```csharp
public class YourSearchPlugin : IPlugin
{
	public Type GetEntityType()
	{
		return typeof(YourSearchableType);
	}

	public string[] GetSearchObjects(string folderPath)
	{
		// Return array of searchable object identifiers
		return Directory.GetFiles(folderPath, "*.yourextension");
	}

	public object CreateEntityInstance(object filePath)
	{
		// Create and return an instance of your searchable type
		return new YourSearchableType((string)filePath);
	}
}
```
